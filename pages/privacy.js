                    We believe You have violated or threatened to violate Our intellectual property rights. The arbitration shall be 
                    conducted by one neutral arbitrator in Denver, Colorado under American Arbitration Association rules then in 
                    effect. No claims of any other parties may be joined or otherwise combined in the arbitration proceeding. Each

                    RIGHT TO A BENCH TRIAL, JURY TRIAL AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE

                    Content shall be governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee, without regard to its choice of law 
                    provisions. Should binding arbitration be deemed invalid or otherwise unenforceable for any reason, the 
                    Dispute Resolution provision of these Terms shall be severed and the parties expressly consent to and agree 
                    that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims will be in state or federal courts in Denver, 
                    Colorado. Severability. If any part of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid 
                    or unenforceable, that part will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law and the remainder of these 
                    Terms will remain fully in force. Waiver. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by any visitor using the 
                    Services does not constitute a waiver of Our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. 
                    Assignment. We may assign Our rights and duties under these Terms without notice to You. You may not assign 
                    these Terms, in whole or in part, without Our prior written consent, and any assignment in contravention of 
                    the foregoing shall be null and void. Termination of Access. We reserve the right to modify or terminate Your 
                    access to the Services (or portions of the Services) at any time, temporarily or permanently, with or without

                    such subject matter. You hereby acknowledge (a) that You have read and understood these Terms, and (b)
